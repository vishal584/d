# Spring JDBC Template Tutorial

This code is part of a tutorial I did for a YouTube video. In this tutorial, you will learn how to list, create, read, update, and delete records from a database in a Spring Boot application using JDBC Template. You will learn how to create a project from scratch, connect to a database, and the various methods in the JDBC Template that allow you to create a full CRUD application.
